# anki-cards

> **UPDATE**: currently I'm using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) with the [Obsidian Anki Sync plugin](https://github.com/debanjandhar12/Obsidian-Anki-Sync) to manage my Anki cards

Anki cards in markdown format (to be managed by "[Anki for VSCode](https://github.com/jasonwilliams/anki)")

**Note:** although I'm making this public, keep in mind that Anki cards works better when you craft your own cards.
